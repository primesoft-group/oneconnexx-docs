The statistics page shows configured statistics from the database. There are four different types of graphs: pie, vertical bar, horizontal bar, and line graph.

### Statistics overview
The functions create, edit and delete are only available for users with admin / configurator rights. 
All statistics areas are displayed on the left and the statistics of the currently active area on the right. If there is no area in the database, the General Statistics area is created. An area can only be deleted if it does not contain any statistics.

#### 1. Statistics area
The name of the area is displayed here, new statistics can be created and the area can be edited. 
If the area contains statistics, the icon for deletion will be grayed out and will not be activated again until all statistics have been deleted from this area. The current area is already selected when it is created.
	
#### 2. Edit and delete statistics
The statistics can be edited by clicking on the icon with the pen and the paper. With the trash can icon, a dialog appears with information that this action has finally been carried out. The statistics are deleted from the database and also removed from the page at the same time.

The order of the statistics within an area can be shifted by means of drap-and-drop. This also immediately adjusts the order of the diagrams.
	
#### 3. Add statistics area
A new statistics area can be added here.

#### 4. Edit statistics
The diagrams of the currently active area are displayed here. If you move the mouse over a diagram, 3 icons are displayed at the top right to **aktualisieren**, **edit ** or **delete** the statistics.
